# The guessing game

The Guessing Game Project is a two-part project. The game is simple. The user guesses a number between 1-100. The app should respond and indicate if their guess is 'hot' or 'cold' based on how close the guess is to the number they are trying to guess. The game should also keep track of previous guesses, and give the user a way to reset the game or get a hint.

## PART 1: HTML / CSS

### ASSIGNMENT

The first portion involves creating the HTML and CSS for the Guessing Game. During this section, do not worry about adding any functionality (JavaScript), focus on adding the HTML and CSS elements and an appealing design to your project!

The Guessing Game project provides a starter repository that provides the base structure for your project. Take your HTML and CSS knowledge and apply them to the requirements outlined below.
